/*
 * The functions callthru0 to callthru7 setup up the arguments for the
 * Mambo callthru and then use the callthru instruction.  Note that
 * 0-7 specify the number of arguments after the command
 */

/* Note: Arguments are cast as unsigned long to prevent casting by the
   compiler.  This way, you can pass pointers, integers, etc. in
   machine register and have the Mambo simulator interpret what the
   register is supposed to be.  To help with typing errors when using
   callthrus, we provide wrapper functions for each callthru.  The
   wrappers cast all arguments to unsigned long.  Unfortunately, this results
   in a lot of compiler warnings that I do not know how to remove.  If
   you modify this code, be aware that we are trying to pick a type
   that is the size of the registers (32-bit or 64-bit) and that is
   why are choosing to cast to a VOID *(it should be the size of a
   machine register)
