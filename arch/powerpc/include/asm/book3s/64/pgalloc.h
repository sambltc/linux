 * Functions that deal with pagetables that could be at any level of

 * handle allocation.  For PTE pages (which are linked to a struct
 * page for now, and drawn from the main get_free_pages() pool), the
 * allocation size will be (2^index_size * sizeof(pointer)) and
 * allocations are drawn from the kmem_cache in PGT_CACHE(index_size).
 *
 * The maximum index size needs to be big enough to allow any
 * pagetable sizes we need, but small enough to fit in the low bits of
 * any page table pointer.  In other words all pagetables, even tiny
 * ones, must be aligned to allow at least enough low 0 bits to
 * contain this value.  This value is also used as a mask, so it must
 * be one less than a power of two.
